#Ishtob's personal planck layout

THis is the default layout used with my planck light, though the rest of the keymap could also be used for the full sized planck or let's split.


Main difference with the default layout:

* Tab take the upper left key, made into a Tap layer to access the symbols from the number row

* Esc moved to lower corner

* Capslock is on the base layer as it is used quite often with my work's software

* Numbers layer on lower is positioned to resemble a numpad with 5 taking the location of J for the homing bump and easier entry


# Secret Macros

`macros_public.h` contains a list of macros that can be replaced with passwords or other sensative private macros. `macros_private.h` will be used if it exsists in the folder during compiling and will ignore `macros_public.h` The private macros can be excluded from git commits by adding it to the exclusion list.
